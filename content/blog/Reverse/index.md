###Reverse a string: 

Solution 1: Using a for loop with ES6 syntax

~~~~
function reverse(string){
  let reversedString = "";
  for(let letter of string){
    reversedString = letter + reversedString;
  }
  return reversedString;
}
~~~~

Solution 2: Relying on reduce

~~~~
function reverse(string){
  return string.split("").reduce((reverse, letter) => letter + reverse, "")
}
~~~~

Solution 3: If you're able to, just use the built-in method

~~~~
function reverse(string){
  return string.split("").reverse().join("");
}
