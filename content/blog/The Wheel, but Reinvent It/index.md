One of the skills I sharpened during my time in coding boot camp was the art of Googling. If you work with programming languages, you know that there are a multitude of built-in functions, methods, and tricks for quickly manipulating code to do something you want it to do. I could never memorize all of these by heart, but after spending weeks and weeks running into both common cases and edge cases alike, I became much better at knowing how to look up exactly what I needed. (Also, side note: I can imagine a time when this wealth of information was not readily available, and I’d just like to take a moment of deep gratitude for people asking and answering questions on the internet.)

Throughout the curriculum at Flatiron School, my cohort would be given labs that would ask us to do things like find the most commonly used character in a string, or make a string into the Pig Latin version of itself, or even manually recreate the reduce function (the worst!). It would at first appear to be a perfect opportunity to use our new search term prowess. Except it was not. We needed to accomplish these challenges without using the built-in tools. 

I detested these exercises. 
## What’s the point of trying to start a fire with two twigs when you have a perfectly functioning lighter right next to you? 

I quickly found out that the point is -- and this is where my analogy completely drops off, but I’m staying committed to it --  that interviewers will ask you to build fires with twigs and verbally communicate your inner thoughts while doing so. No lighters allowed.

Why is this? 

**1. Engineers should be able to problem solve**

Software engineers should absolutely have knowledge about programming languages, but at the end of the day, the job is about solving problems and less about knowing the exact syntax of a function in JavaScript vs. the exact syntax of a method in Ruby. That’s Google’s time to shine. 

**2. Logic questions predict performance**

The point of an interview is to get a feel for how a candidate would perform as an employee. Technical employees need to be highly logical and innovative in their thinking, ever ready to look at problems from different perspectives. Logic puzzles and algorithmic questions are a great way to see this ability and guess how it could translate into the larger picture. Furthermore, these types of questions reveal how candidates react in stressful, high-pressure situations. Does the interviewee ask for help? Heed to suggestions? Give up easily? Completely choke? The fact that interviews are a terrible way to predict actual workplace performance and work quality is another blog post...

**3. Seats need butts in them, and this is a scalable way to sort through a big pile o’ butts**

Asking interviewees to solve algorithmic/logic questions is a speedy and scalable way to move them through the funnel. Interviewers can compare candidates’ answers efficiently, shift the specific question up or down a notch in terms of difficulty depending on how the interview is going, and most importantly, it’s very easy to see if the solution to “reverse a string without using the built-in .reverse() function” works. There’s no grey area, no room for storytelling, and little to no need for debate over whether or not the problem was solved. 

**4. Logic questions create an even playing field** 

Because they are background and programming language agnostic (most of the time), algorithmic questions allow candidates to demonstrate their problem-solving abilities pretty much in a vacuum. This is good. Especially for people like me, who come from a completely unrelated job.

**5. It’s always been that way**

This is the weakest reason in my opinion. A lot of things have “always been that way” and that doesn’t mean they are useful or superior or the most efficient. But we can worry about being the change we seek after we get the job.

Knowing the information above, *especially reason numero cinco*, we can walk into interviews prepared, which will not only impress the interviewer, but will also get everyone to the more enjoyable part of talking about additional creative approaches to these problems.


And here is the really good news: Google and built-in methods are not going away. They’ll just be waiting on the other side of that interviewing room. 

If you’d like to actually see some different approaches in solving a few of these questions (in JavaScript), my next blog post will cover it. Check back next week!
